# NAND-Grinder

A puzzle game about creating logical and mathematical operations using electrical circuits. Inspired by Sebastian League's _Exploring how Computers Work_. You can play the game by following this link: https://nand-grinder.bib04.repl.co/. There are sound effects, truth tables, demonstartions, and shortcuts to help you through the levels and ultimatately create a calculator capable of adding two four-bit numbers.

## How to play:
Press buttons in bottom left to create logic gates.
* Shortcut: Use numbers 1-9 to select your desired gate and left-click to place

Connect two gates by clicking on one gates output (black circle on right side) and clicking on another gates input.
* Shortcut: click and drag between output and input

Too test your circuit, left-click the input pegs to turn them on/off

Too remove a gate, right click it or drag it out of the box

Hover over output (grey/black peg on the right) to see a truth table clarifying the logic operation (white input, red output)

Press "demo" in bottom right to see the model inputs and outputs

Press "check" in bottom right to check of you correctly solved the puzzle
* If wrong, nothing happens
